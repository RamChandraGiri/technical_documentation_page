Kotlin Documentation

Live on: https://ramchandragiri.github.io/technical_documentation_page/

This is freecodecamp.org Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Technical Documentation Page.

Issues that I will fixed later:

1. Making fixed sidebar (nav) more responsive for very small devices.
2. Improving overall look.

Will update after learning and working on JS.

Thank you.
