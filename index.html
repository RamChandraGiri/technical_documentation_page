                <p>Before proceeding with this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of Java programming
                    language. Although it is a beginners’ tutorial, I assume that the readers have a reasonable exposure
                    to any programming environment and knowledge of basic concepts such as variables, commands, syntax,
                    etc. I strongly recommend that you gain some basic knowledge of Java programming language before
                    proceeding with Kotlin programming.</p>

            <header>Advantages and Disadvantages</header>
            <article>
                <P>Following are some of the advantages of using Kotlin for your application development.</P>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Easy Language</dt>
                    <dd>Kotlin is a functional language and very easy to learn. The syntax is pretty much similar to
                        Java, hence it is very easy to remember. Kotlin is more expressive, which makes your code more
                        readable and understandable.</dd>

                    <dt>Concise</dt>
                    <dd>Kotlin is based on JVM and it is a functional language. Thus, it reduce lots of boiler plate
                        code used in other programming languages.</dd>

                    <dt>Runtime and Performance</dt>
                    <dd>Better performance and small runtime.</dd>

                    <dt>Interoperability</dt>
                    <dd>Kotlin is mature enough to build an interoperable application in a less complex manner.</dd>

                    <dt>Brand New</dt>
                    <dd>Kotlin is a brand new language that gives developers a fresh start. It is not a replacement of
                        Java, though it is developed over JVM. It is accepted as the first official language of android
                        development. Kotlin can be defined as - Kotlin = JAVA + extra updated new features.</dd>
                </dl>

                <p>Following are some of the disadvantages of Kotlin.</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Namespace declaration</dt>
                    <dd>Kotlin allows developers to declare the functions at the top level. However, whenever the same
                        function is declared in many places of your application, then it is hard to understand which
                        function is being called.</dd>

                    <dt>No Static Declaration</dt>
                    <dd>Kotlin does not have usual static handling modifier like Java, which can cause some problem to
                        the conventional Java developer.</dd>
                </dl>

            <article>
                <p>However, if you still want to use Kotlin offline in your local system, then you need to execute the
                    following steps to configure your local workspace.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Java 8 installation
                    </li>
                    <p>Kotlin runs on JVM, hence. it is really necessary to use JDK 8 for your local Kotlin development.
                    </p>
                    <li>
                        IDE installation.
                    </li>
                    <p>There are a number of IDE available over the internet. Like: NetBeans, Eclipse, Intellij</p>
                    <li>
                        Configure your IDE
                    </li>
                    <p>Install Kotlin development plugins in your IDE.</p>
                    <li>
                        Create project &amp; test
                    </li>
                    <p>When your development environment is ready, create a Kotlin project. Add the following piece of
                        code in the “project_name.kt” file.</p>
                    <code>fun main(args: Array<String>) {<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println("Hello, World!")<br>
                    }</code><br>
                    <p>Run it as a Kotlin application and see the output in the console as shown in the following
                        screenshot.</p>
                    <code>Hello, World!</code><br>

            <header>Architecture</header>
            <article>
                <p>Kotlin is a programming language and has its own architecture to allocate memory and produce a
                    quality output to the end user. Following are the different scenarios where Kotlin compiler will
                    work differently, whenever it is targeting different other kind of languages such as Java and
                    JavaScript.</p>
                <p>Kotlin compiler creates a byte code and that byte code can run on the JVM, which is exactly equal to
                    the byte code generated by the Java .class file. Whenever two byte coded file runs on the JVM, they
                    can communicate with each other and this is how an interoperable feature is established in Kotlin
                    for Java.</p>
                <p>Whenever Kotlin targets JavaScript, the Kotlin compiler converts the .kt file into ES5.1 and
                    generates a compatible code for JavaScript. Kotlin compiler is capable of creating platform basis
                    compatible codes via LLVM.</p>

            <article>
                <p>In this chapter, we will learn about the basic data types available in Kotlin programming language.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Numbers</li>
                    <li>Characters</li>
                    <li>Boolean</li>
                    <li>Strings</li>
                    <li>Arrays</li>

        <section id="Control_Flow" class="main-section">
            <header>Control Flow</header>
            <article>
                <p>There are different types of control flow mechanism available in the Kotlin. Like:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If-Else</li>
                    <li>For Loop</li>
                    <li>While Loop and Do-While Loop</li>
                    <li>Use of Return, Break, Continue, When</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>We will discuss in detail about <strong>For loop</strong>.</p>
                <p>The implementation and use of For loop is conceptually similar to Java for loop. The following
                    example shows how we can use the same in real-life examples.</p>
                <code>fun main(args: Array<String>) {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;val items = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4)<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for (i in items) println("values of the array"+i)<br>
                }</code><br>

                <p>In the above piece of code, we have declared one list named as “items” and using for loop we are
                    iterating through that defined list and printing its value in the browser. Following is the output.
                </p>
                <code>values of the array1<br>
                values of the array2<br>
                values of the array3<br>
                >values of the array4</code><br>

                <p>Following is another example of code, where we are using some library function to make our
                    development work easier than ever before.</p>

                <code>fun main(args: Array<String>) {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;val items = listOf(1, 22, 83, 4)<br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for ((index, value) in items.withIndex()) {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println("the element at $index is $value")<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
                }</code><br>

                <p>Once we compile and execute the above piece of code in our coding ground, it will yield the following
                    output in the browser.</p>
                <code>the element at 0 is 1<br>
                the element at 1 is 22<br>
                the element at 2 is 83<br>
                the element at 3 is 4</code><br>

        <section id="Functions" class="main-section">
            <header>Functions</header>
            <article>
                <p>Kotlin is a statically typed language, hence, functions play a great role in it. We are pretty
                    familiar with function, as we are using function throughout the examples. Function is declared with
                    the keyword “fun”. Like any other OOP, it also needs a return type and an option argument list.</p>
                <p>In the following example, we are defining a function called MyFunction and from the main function we
                    are calling this function and passing some argument.</p>

                <code>fun main(args: Array<String>) {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;println(MyFunction("This Tutorial"))<br>
                }br>
                fun MyFunction(x: String): String {<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var c:String  = "Hey!! Welcome To "<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return (c+x)<br>
                }</code><br>

                <p>The above piece of code will yield the following output in the browser.</p>
                <code>Hey!! Welcome To This Tutorial</code><br>

                <p>Some of the different types of function available in Kotlin are as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lambda Function</li>
                    <li>Inline Function</li>
                </ul>

        <section id="Exception_Handling" class="main-section">
            <header>Exception Handling</header>
            <article>
                <p>Exception handling is a very important part of a programming language. This technique restricts our
                    application from generating the wrong output at runtime. In this chapter, we will learn how to
                    handle runtime exception in Kotlin. The exceptions in Kotlin is pretty similar to the exceptions in
                    Java. All the exceptions are descendants of the “Throwable” class.</p>

                <p><em>Note</em>: Like Java, Kotlin also executes the finally block after executing the catch block.</p>
